Digital version "in a nut shell"

Server and client 

## The game
Players take it in turns to uncover words in order to try to guess the answer.


**Questions:**
 A question is broken down in to words, all hidden. The players take it in turns to either uncover a word or guess the answer. Each time a word is revealed the score/pot is reduced (except maybe turn one). For example "How many hours are in one day" might be worth 70 points. 

**Description**: 
like the question but descriptive. A description is presented, hidden, and the players reveal any one word at a time .

**Wordbank:** 
a number of related, maybe tenuously, words to the answer. A thing, a concept, whatever.


**Ways to play:**
- Going 'around', player 1 uncovers a word, player 2 either reveals or guesses, and so on. 
- Hide words - player 1 hides/reveals a number of words from the questions/description/wordbank. 


The game board would be displayed on one device, Jackbox style, with clients seeing 'info' on their devices. It might be nice to also do this a a play on one device type game.
