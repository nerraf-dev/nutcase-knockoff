Currently, on answering correctly this is the output after the first question:
```bash
Answer submitted: 24
Player submitted answer: 24
CORRECT ANSWER!

```


The game screen after round 1:
![[Pasted image 20260109130119.png]]
The new question loads, question value updated, player list scores updated. But now we have indicated that player 1 is next. It should indicate the leader. On a new round, who goes first? The winner of the previous round? The next player in the 'circle'? 

Answering the new question: 
The new question appears, works as expected. When answered correctly - if there is no winner still another question appears. If answered incorrectly the player loses points but rather than 'freezing' the player and letting remaining players have a go at the question it loads a new question. 

```
Next turn: Player 3
Guess button pressed. Current pot: 150
Answer submitted: 207
Player submitted answer: 207
WRONG ANSWER. The correct answer was: 206
Player Player 3 answered incorrectly!
Player 3 scored -75 points! Total: 75
No winner yet, continuing to next round.
Player 1 is back in the game!
Player 2 is back in the game!
Player 3 is back in the game!
All players unfrozen

```


If the answer given is correct, and there is a word/string match, then a scene should load - well done player, etc - and then move on to the new question that loads behind. 

Need to do 'incorrect' guess logic. 


## Design Decisions Made

**Wrong Answer Behaviour:**
- Player loses 50% of current score
- Player frozen for remainder of question
- EXCEPTION: If only 1 player left unfrozen → "free guess" (no penalty)
- Turn continues to next unfrozen player

**Turn Order:**
- Winner of round starts next round
- Then continues in list order from there
- Example: P1→P2→P3→P4, P2 wins → Next round: P2→P3→P4→P1

**Player Badges:**
- Remove leader icon
- Keep current player indicator
- Consider: Colour-coding by rank

## To Do
* Wire up title screen options and exit button.
	* Options needs a scene to go to.
* Options menu scene (different on home to in-game?)
* New Game Settings - Wire up **home** button.
* **Fix answering incorrectly - implement freeze logic & free guess**
* **Implement "winner starts next round" turn order**
* New scenes for transitions: correct answer, game winner, settings -> new game
* Player list - game board: 
	* Remove leader icon
	* Fix current player indicator to show actual current player
	* Consider colour-coding badges by rank
