- Splash screen loads and times out correctly
- Start button takes you to settings
- Settings screen operates as expected
- Confirm pop-up appears with correct data
- Pressing confirm takes you to game board. There is a delay between button press and board loading. maybe add a loading screen?
- Game screen loads, sliders clickable, they uncover
- answer pop-up loads accepts the answers
- On correct points are awarded, correct overlay appears
	- Need to update overlay so the player list is hidden
- Round continues if player guesses incorrectly they lose points
	- If correct (currently an exact match!) game proceeds as expected.
	- If incorrect: game continues fine if mpore than one player remains. But for one left it needs to limit them to only able to guess. This guess however is free, so if incorrect they are not penalised.
- When there is a inner need to freeze or even hide the game board. Dispaly the end of round screen (to be completed) showing winner and results. could include some game stats, or 'fun facts'
	- Screen needs to offer an option to play again with the same settings, return to home or exit. 

Quick fixes?
- wire up home screen exit - needs to exit cleanly.
- change the player list icon to show the leader rather than player triangle
