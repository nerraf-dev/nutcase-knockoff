## Project Status: "In a Nutshell" - Jackbox-Style Word Reveal Game

**✅ What's Working Now:**

**Core Game Mechanics**
- ✅ Word reveal system with animated sliders
- ✅ Numbered words (1-indexed) for player selection
- ✅ Pot scoring system with difficulty multipliers
  - Easy: 100 pts | Medium: 150 pts | Hard: 200 pts
- ✅ Minimum pot guarantee (10% always reserved)
- ✅ Pot reduces as words revealed, never goes below minimum

**Data & Content Management**
- ✅ Question resource class (`Question.gd`) with typed properties
- ✅ JSON-based question storage (`questions.json`)
- ✅ QuestionLoader with filtering (by difficulty, category)
- ✅ Random question selection
- ✅ 5 sample questions loaded

**UI Components**
- ✅ Host display with grid layout
- ✅ Slider component with reveal animation
- ✅ Pot display updates in real-time
- ✅ Multi-input support (mouse, touch, keyboard, controller)

**❌ What's Missing / Next Steps:**

**Game Flow & State Management**
- ❌ Round system (track current round, total rounds)
- ❌ Turn management (whose turn it is)
- ❌ Player management (add players, track scores)
- ❌ Guess answer functionality (only reveal works now)
- ❌ Answer validation and scoring
- ❌ Win conditions (first to X, most points after Y rounds)
- ❌ Challenge system (for disputing answers)

**Multiplayer / Networking**
- ❌ WebSocket server (host side)
- ❌ WebSocket client (mobile device side)
- ❌ Mobile device UI screens
  - Join lobby screen
  - Player action buttons (Reveal/Guess)
  - Answer input screen
- ❌ Room codes for joining games
- ❌ Player state sync (scores, turn status, frozen state)

**UI Screens Needed**
- ❌ Main menu / game setup
- ❌ Lobby screen (waiting for players)
- ❌ Round transition screens
- ❌ Scoreboard display
- ❌ Answer reveal screen
- ❌ Winner announcement screen

**Game Modes**
- ❌ "Around" mode implementation
- ❌ "Hide" mode implementation
- ❌ Game settings (# of rounds, first to N, etc.)

**Data & Content**
- ❌ More questions (currently only 5)
- ❌ Category filtering UI
- ❌ Tag-based question selection

**Polish**
- ❌ Sound effects
- ❌ Background music
- ❌ Visual themes
- ❌ Animations for scoring/transitions

**🎯 Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order):**

1. **Player & Turn Management** - Create Player class, add turn system, track who can act
2. **Guess Answer Flow** - Add "Guess" button functionality, answer input, validation
3. **Basic Round System** - Track rounds, advance to next question, basic win condition
4. **Scoreboard** - Display all players and their scores
5. **Networking Foundation** - Set up WebSocket server/client architecture
6. **Mobile UI** - Create simple mobile screens (join, action buttons)
7. **Polish & Content** - Add more questions, sounds, animations

Would you like to tackle **Player/Turn Management** or **Guess Answer** next? Those are the critical systems needed before networking makes sense.
